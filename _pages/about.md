I am a Ph.D. candidate at Caltech researching the fundamental physics underlying aqueous polyelectrolyte and ion complexation.
By utilizing a combination of multiscale simulations, machine learning techniques, and theoretical approaches, I explore the intricate macroscopic structure and relaxation phenomena within these systems.

I possess a diverse skill set that includes expertise in transport phenomena, statistical mechanics, and polymer physics.
I have developed a strong ability to break down complex problems into their core components and drive independent progress.
My passion lies in physics-based modelling and I thrive in fast-paced environments, quickly grasping new concepts and applying them effectively to solve challenges.
