I am a current Ph.D. candidate from Caltech, where I study the fundamental physics that underlies the dynamics of polyelectrolyte and small ion complexes in an aqueous solvent.
I utilize a combination of multiscale simulation techniques and theoretical models to understand and predict the interesting macroscopic structure and relaxation phenomena.

My training as a researcher has taught me how to distill complex problems into their most essential aspects and make progress independently.
I have a broad background in applied mathematics and computer science and have experience in transport phenomena, statistical mechanics, and polymer physics.
