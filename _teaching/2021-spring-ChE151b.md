The foundations of heat, mass, and momentum transfer for single and multiphase fluids will be developed.
Governing differential equations; laminar flow of incompressible fluids at low and high Reynolds numbers; forced and free convective heat and mass transfer, diffusion, and dispersion.
Emphasis will be placed on physical understanding, scaling, and formulation and solution of boundary-value problems.
Applied mathematical techniques will be developed and used throughout the course.
